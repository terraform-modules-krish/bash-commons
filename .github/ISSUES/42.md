Now that we've migrated many of our repos over to use `bash-commons` as a dependency, we should think of a reasonable way to check / enforce the minimum version of `bash-commons` that a module may need. 

For example, ensuring that you're at least running `v0.1.8` of `bash-commons` which introduced support for IMDSv2.
