# Local readonly variables not declared correctly

**brikis98** commented *Oct 23, 2018*

We currently use `local readonly` to declare local, read-only variables. It turns out that this [is not the right way to do it](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45409823/483528). The proper way is:

```bash
local -r var="$1"
```

For arrays, you need:

```bash
local -ar var=(foo bar)
```

I believe this is resolved in #8.

You're right! This was fixed by https://github.com/gruntwork-io/bash-commons/pull/11. Finally closing :)
