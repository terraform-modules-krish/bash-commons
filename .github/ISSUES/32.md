# Add a function for calculating a rally point instance as part of an AWS Auto Scaling Group

**yardbirdsax** commented *Apr 2, 2021*

Similar to the logic [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-couchbase/blob/master/modules/couchbase-commons/couchbase-rally-point), a function should exist that can be used to calculate a single "rally point" instance out of a pool of instances in an AWS Auto Scaling Group. This would be useful in cases where commands need to be run once as part of a bootstrapping process (e.g. something like hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul#119).
