# I'd like to submit a PR, but first...

**housni** commented *Oct 23, 2018*

I love this repo! There's a great set of tools here for users.

I would like to submit a few PR's but I wanted to first clarify if it's something you would use.

1. Generally, using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` is considered compatible so I'd like to make that change.
2. I'd like to make all the code `shellcheck` compatible.
3. I think it would be a good idea to set things like `pipefail`, `nounset`, `errtrace`, `functrace`, etc, in the scripts. Especially `pipefail` because I can see the scripts have some pipes so if commands in the pipes fail, we are not going to see those failures unless they are obvious. See: https://www.davidpashley.com/articles/writing-robust-shell-scripts/
4. I'd like to add a lot more functionality (I'm sure you won't have any objection to this :)). I can port some of the functionality in my own Bash library (https://github.com/housni/sheldon) to this repo, making sure I stick to the guidelines in the README.

Thoughts?

Thank you!

Can you provide more info/context around this?

That sounds like a great idea!

This sounds great too. I wasn't familiar with a few of these, thx!

Cool library! Contributions are very welcome 👍 

What were you thinking of adding?

BTW, if you're going to be following our conventions, take note of [one issue](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/bash-commons/issues/9) we recently found and still need to fix!

Sure. The rationale is that, `bash` doesn't always live in `/usr/bin` or `/bin` but `env` always exists at `/usr/bin/env`. Since `env` knows where `bash` lives, we can use it to get the correct `bash` interpreter for that system.

```
$ env | grep -i bash
SHELL=/bin/bash
```

A bunch of things like string and array functions as I have implemented them here (but according to your coding standards :)): https://github.com/housni/sheldon/tree/master/lib/sheldon/util
I'll be creating a separate PR for the extra functions so you can decide on what works and what doesn't.

Noted! I did notice the existing syntax and realized I had not seen that before and I was wondering if it was one of those Bash-isms that I didn't know about :)

Thanks for the explanation. This sounds good to me!

I've almost completed PR #11 but I was wondering if things like `pipefail`, `nounset`, `errtrace`, `functrace`, etc, even belong here. I suppose I could update the [Examples section README](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/bash-commons#examples) to add something like this to the existing example:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# our traps need access to some vars to do their job properly.
set -o errtrace
set -o functrace

# exit if any command exits with a non-zero exit status.
set -e

# exit if script uses undefined variables.
set -u

# prevent masking an error in a pipeline.
#
# look at the end of the 'Use set -e' section for an excellent explanation.
# see: https://www.davidpashley.com/articles/writing-robust-shell-scripts/
set -o pipefail

# less eager word splitting - no space.
IFS=$'\n\t'

# Make debugging easier when you use `set -x`
# See: http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/debuggingtips#making_xtrace_more_useful
export PS4='+(${BASH_SOURCE}:${LINENO}): ${FUNCNAME[0]:+${FUNCNAME[0]}(): }'
```

That's useful info but it's also noisy so I'll let you decide.

Perhaps these should go into a `flags.sh` that all the scripts `source` right at the top?
***

**housni** commented *Oct 27, 2018*

We can have a `flags.sh` that every script sources. Or we can have something like a `bootstrap.sh` which we'd ask users to source at the top of their user scripts, if they want to.

What do you think works better here?
***

**brikis98** commented *Oct 28, 2018*

A `bootstrap.sh` sounds good. Note that we'd need to update the docs to recommend `source`ing this file right at the top and update the tests in this repo to do the same.
***

**housni** commented *Oct 29, 2018*

Sounds great!

Also, I'll have CircleCI run `shellcheck` as a part of CI.
***

**housni** commented *Nov 5, 2018*

I think that PR is ready to be merged in. Can we hook up CircleCI? I run `shellcheck` via CircleCI now.
Btw, added `bootstrap.sh` caused the tests to exit. There's a lot of tests so I thought it would be best if it had it's own PR in the interest of completing PR #11.
***

**housni** commented *Nov 5, 2018*

Btw, CircleCI **should** run `shellcheck` against every file that begins with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` regardless of the file extension.
***

**housni** commented *Nov 5, 2018*

Scratch that, I have one more thing to do before we can merge!

OK, let me know when it's ready for another review!
***

**housni** commented *Nov 12, 2018*

Ok, I think this PR is ready for a review now.
Just one thing: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/bash-commons/pull/11#pullrequestreview-173726273
***

**housni** commented *Nov 12, 2018*

Btw, is CircleCI hooked up? It should run `shellcheck` and `bats`.
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 12, 2018*

Yes, CircleCI is hooked up, but does not run on external PRs.
***

**housni** commented *Nov 28, 2018*

Btw, the PR is ready to go, whenever you want to merge it.
***

**brikis98** commented *Nov 28, 2018*

My bad, I lost track of this one. Thank you for the reminder and the great contribution. Merged now! I'll mark this issue as closed.
***

**housni** commented *Nov 28, 2018*

Awesome! Glad to be able to contribute!
