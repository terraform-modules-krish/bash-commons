**Describe the solution you'd like**
Per [this discussion](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/knowledge-base/discussions/286), we need to develop an publicize a strategy for expanding support for distros such as Rocky Linux / AlmaLinux.

Note that this will involve: 
1. Writing up a strategy and publishing it somewhere visible, either in the knowledge base, or on the docs site. 
1. Extending bash-commons to be able to recognize any new distros we add support for. Currently this logic is in `os.sh`.
1. Adding regression tests throughout our modules to ensure that they behave correctly on the new distros. For example, [in our `ntp-module`](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security/blob/master/modules/ntp/install.sh#L60) we actually only support Amazon linux, Ubuntu and CentOS.

Closing as I'm no longer working at Gruntwork and this issue requires revalidation.
