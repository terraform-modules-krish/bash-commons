# Make IMDSv2 the default for bash-commons

**zackproser** commented *Oct 11, 2021*

With [this PR](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/bash-commons/pull/38#issuecomment-940148157), we implemented support for AWS EC2 Instance Metadata Service version 2. 

See the following links for information on the difference between versions 1 and 2 and why version 2 is preferred: 

- [Use IMDSv2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html)
- [Blog post introducing IMDSv2 and its enhancements](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/defense-in-depth-open-firewalls-reverse-proxies-ssrf-vulnerabilities-ec2-instance-metadata-service/)

[A version switch was implemented here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/bash-commons/blob/607e5f597b3f08bf65e6e051fe5253161f11d229/modules/bash-commons/src/aws.sh#L35-L39). 

It is looking for the env var `GRUNTWORK_BASH_COMMONS_IMDS_VERSION`, and falling back to the default specified in `default_instance_metadata_version`. Right now, bash-commons is capable of using either version 1 or version 2 of the IMDS. However, it is currently defaulting to version 1 so as to not break any consumers unexpectedly. 

Meanwhile, we are going through our repos and upgrading them to use `bash-commons` where applicable and to ensure they can use IMDSv2 without issue. 

Once we have successfully cut over all our repos to IMDSv2, we should flip `bash-commons` to use IMDSv2 by default, since it is preferred. We can accomplish this by setting `default_instance_metadata_version` to `2` [right here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/bash-commons/blob/607e5f597b3f08bf65e6e051fe5253161f11d229/modules/bash-commons/src/aws.sh#L21).
