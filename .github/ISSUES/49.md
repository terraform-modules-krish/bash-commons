# Add a log_debug to the log script

**hoshposh** commented *Mar 15, 2023*

## Overview

Provide a `DEBUG` log level that also accepts a parameter to indicate if debug logging has been turned on.

```bash
# invocation example
log_debug "only want to see this when debug on" "true"

# expected output
[DEBUG] only want to see this when debug on

# Another invocation example
log_debug "only want to see this when debug on" "false"

# No expected output
```
