# renovate.json config doesn't detect backwards incompatible changes correctly

The template we're using to render parts of the PR body _always_ say the change is backwards incompatible, even for patch version bumps. Must be some issue in the `renovate.json`.

@brikis98 Did you intend to file this here, in `bash-commons`?

lol, no, no I did not 😁 

No clue how that happened, closing this issue and will re-open in proper repo 🤦
