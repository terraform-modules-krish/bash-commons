# bash-commons v0.0.1

**brikis98** commented *Apr 10, 2018*

This PR creates the first version of the `bash-commons` repo.

It includes helpers for:

* arrays
* assert
* aws
* files
* logging
* OS
* strings

I’ve also included the ability to install these helpers via the Gruntwork Installer and automated tests. There are plenty more helpers and tests that we’ll migrate here over time, but this should be a good starting point.

This is a large PR, so it might be easier to browse the [v0.0.1 branch](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/bash-commons/tree/v0.0.1) directly.
