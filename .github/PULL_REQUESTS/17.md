# Add testing for ubuntu18.04

**yorinasub17** commented *Aug 5, 2019*

This adds testing for Ubuntu18.04 so that we verify compatibility with Ubuntu 18.04.

**Maintainer's note**: I am a bit on the fence whether it should be necessary to test both Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04, since it adds quite a bit of overhead to the docker setup, including port management. For CI it isn't a problem because we run each test in a separate CircleCI instance, but when running locally, you no longer can do `docker-compose up` to run all the tests (due to the port conflict).

More generally, we should refactor the tests so that we can test multiple OSes, such as CentOS and Amazon Linux, similar to https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer
