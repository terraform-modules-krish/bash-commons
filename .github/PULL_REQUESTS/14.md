# Add commons commands from package-zookeeper and package-kafka

**jeckhart** commented *Mar 3, 2019*

Both the Zookeeper and Kafka packages have forks of bash-commons. This is my attempt to merge them all back into a single place. I have patches for package-zookeeper and package-kafka that use this new, combined bash-commons pending this merge.

I added tests where I could. Unfortunately, moto doesn't support enis afaik so I was unable to add tests for the eni functions I copied over.

Everything else should have a test and is confirmed to pass.
