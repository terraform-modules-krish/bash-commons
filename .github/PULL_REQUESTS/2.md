# Add tests and fixes for AWS helpers

**brikis98** commented *Apr 12, 2018*

In #1, I had test for everything but the two AWS bash scripts, as those are tricky to unit test. I started to use those scripts in another project, and, not too surprisingly, hit a bug.

So, I bit the bullet, and figured out how to unit test these suckers using `moto`, a mock EC2 metadata server, and some other hacks. It was a PITA, that included some yak shaving around bats, but the upside is I actually found and fixed several bugs, so I guess it was worth the effort.

Merging now. Please take a look, as there are some handy patterns here for mocking out EC2 metadata, AWS APIs, overriding AWS CLI behavior, etc. Feedback welcome!
