Fixes #32 as well as updating the Dockerfiles used for testing to use Python 3 (I could not get them to run using the older Python version).

I believe I should split out the unit tests here for the private vs public DNS name usage, but wanted to get this up in the meantime for a review other than that.

I split the unit tests out and also refactored the new tests such that the setup code for each set isn't duplicated. The latter isn't the same way other things are done, so if you'd like me to back that out and just have the code in each test let me know. Thanks!
