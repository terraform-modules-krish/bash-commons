# Switch to v2 of the Instance Metadata Service API

**cornet** commented *May 28, 2021*

Update all calls to use IMDSv2[1] which is a session-based rather than just
simple request-response. This requires 2 changes:

- Obtaining a session token from `/latest/api/token`
- Passing this token in a `X-aws-ec2-metadata-token` header when making
requests.

IMDSv2 is enabled by default and AWS Foundation Security Best Practices
recommends v1 not be used due to a number of potential security
vulnerabilities[2].

@bwhaley If you are going to dive into https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-openvpn/pull/132, might be worth looking into this one too! See also https://gruntwork.atlassian.net/browse/IAC-1847.

@cornet Thanks for the PRs! To provide some context, IMDSv2 is on our backlog, and one of the things we'll need to figure out is what practices / patterns we want to adopt around it. E.g., We may want to capture the best practices with IMDSv2 in this `bash-commons` repo (similar to your PR), and then update all our other repos to use `bash-commons` (many already do, but some, that came before `bash-commons` existed, do not).

Thanks @brikis98 for the context, and @cornet for the PRs! Given the dependencies and downstream impacts this will take a little time to review, but it's now in my queue.

Hey - just wondering if there is any update on this or when it's likely that IMDSv2 will be tackled ?
