# Minor fix for bootstrap compat

**jeckhart** commented *Mar 17, 2019*

Found a minor issue when running with bootstrap.sh. The iterator was iterating one time too many.

Also fixes the example for array_split which had the args reversed.

I was trying to think about how to test bootstrap failures. I'm not an expert on BATS. I think it would be a separate test suite for bootstrap.sh that calls each function.

Wait, haha, I just realized this PR doesn't include any changes to `bootstrap.sh`; only `assert.sh` and `array.sh`...

Correct, this was minor changes elsewhere. I found them after adding bootstrap.sh to some of our scripts.

Ah, OK. So is there a test case for `assert_exactly_one_of` that would've caught that bug?

Unfortunately not that I can see. Bash is pretty forgiving if a var isn't
defined, so the code ends up doing the right thing in spite of itself. I
haven't dug into BATS to see if it has a mechanism to test for this though.
