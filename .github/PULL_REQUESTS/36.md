# Fix build

**yorinasub17** commented *Jun 10, 2021*

This PR includes several fixes:

- Add a regression test for sudo functionality for user mod functions introduced in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/bash-commons/pull/35.
- Added testing for Ubuntu 20.04
- Fix test pipeline such that error codes are propagated. Before, circleci would **always be green** even if the bats tests failed!
- Fix the failing tests that were revealed from updating the test pipeline.
- Fix bug in sudo functionality for user mod functions.
- `s/local readonly/local -r/g`

I know this is a lot, so if necessary, I can break up the PR to separate out the fixes.

Thanks for review! I addressed the comments, and since they don't need code changes, I'll go ahead and merge this in!
