@yorinasub17 any idea why this failed? I don't know where to go to see the results of the test, the pages I try to load give 404.

I'm not sure - but I restarted the build in case it was something transient unrelated to your changes @calebtote. Hope that's alright @yorinasub17

The tests failed because of a python2.7 incompatibility. See https://github.com/gruntwork-io/bash-commons/pull/22 for the fix. This is now merged as part of #22.
