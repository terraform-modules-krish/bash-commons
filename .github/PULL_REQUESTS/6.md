# Add function to get instance with specific tags

**tonerdo** commented *Aug 31, 2018*

This PR is meant to address a need in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-elk/pull/43. Specifically this comment https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-elk/pull/43#discussion_r213864939 about using tags to retrieve IPs instead of ASG names.

The PR includes the following:
1. A function `aws_get_instances_with_tag` within `aws.sh` that simply returns the json result from the call to the `aws-cli`
2. A function `aws_wrapper_get_ips_with_tag` within `aws-wrapper.sh` that calls the `aws_get_instances_with_tag` function and returns the public or private IPs of the instances 
3. Tests which have not yet been added because I'm still trying to figure out bats
