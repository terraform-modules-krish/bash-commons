2. Makes scripts `shellcheck` compatible.
3. Runs `shellcheck` in CircleCI as part of the CI.
4. Set `pipefail`, `nounset`, `errtrace`, `functrace`, etc. via `bootstrap.sh` to encourage good shell scripting practice.

Wow, I made so many mistakes! That's what happens when you code at 4am on a Monday morning :D
Thanks for the awesome PR review! If you find more mistakes, please let me know.
